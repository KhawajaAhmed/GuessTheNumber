# GuessTheNumber
The computer generates a random, secret number that the player has to guess in 6 tries. Everytime the player makes a guess that is not the secret number, the computer gives a hint to the player-printing to the screen whether the secret number is higher or lower than the current guess. The game has been written in python and makes use of control flows and iteration.
